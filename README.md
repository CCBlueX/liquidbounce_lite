# LiquidBounce Lite
LiquidBounce Lite is a Minecraft DLL Injection Client designed to be injected using a DLL Injection method, such as Process Hacker. It is specifically developed for Windows operating systems. This project is open-source and free to use. It serves as a smaller sister project to LiquidBounce, offering fewer features but with a strong focus on being highly undetectable. Notable features include self-destruct functionality and screenshare proofing. \

Please note that the project is currently a work in progress and does not have any functional features at the moment. However, we have exciting plans for its future development.

# Technology Stack
LiquidBounce Lite is completely written in Rust programming language. All of its features are implemented using Rust, with no Java code involved. Additionally, it utilizes the FabricMC yarn mappings to remap the Minecraft obfuscated environment.
